Welcome to my personal academic homepage.

I am **Hang Lu**, a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering with a research focus on **optoelectronic devices and photonic integration**.

I am currently pursuing my PhD at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in the Photonics Laboratory, under the supervision of Prof. Boon S. Ooi. My research centers on semiconductor optoelectronic devices and photonic integrated circuits (PICs), with particular emphasis on lasers, especially VCSELs, microLEDs, and photonic integration, especially emitter–detector co-integrated architectures, and their applications in high-speed communication, imaging, illumincation, and hardware security.

My work adopts a full-stack approach to photonic system development, spanning device physics modeling and III–V epitaxial analysis, nanofabrication and process integration**, and optical/electrical characterization with system-level validation**. I have established end-to-end PIC development workflows covering lasers, micro-LEDs, waveguides, gratings, and photodetectors, and evaluated their performance in GHz-class optical links**, beam-steering systems, and imaging platforms using customized optical and RF measurement setups.

I am a member of the **Photonics Laboratory at KAUST**  
([Group website](https://www.kaustphotonics.org/)),  
and my research activities are closely aligned with the lab’s efforts in integrated photonics and advanced optoelectronic systems.
